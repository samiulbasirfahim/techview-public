					Semantic elements have meaningful names which tells about
					type of content. For example header, footer, table, â€¦ etc.
					HTML5 introduces many semantic elements as mentioned below
					which make the code easier to write and understand for the
					developer as well as instructs the browser on how to treat
					them.

					user devices to determine the importance and context of web
					pages. The pages made with semantic elements are much easier

					Inline elements vs inline block elements?
				</p>
				<p className="font-mono text-gray-700 text-justify">
					inline elements display in a line. They do not force the
					text after them to a new line. An anchor (or link) is an
					example of an inline element. You can put several links in a
					row, and they will display in a line.such as ( a, small ,
					button, img)
					<br />A block-level element always starts on a new line and
					takes up the full width available. An inline element does
					not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width
					as necessary.. example of block element (p, h1, div, br)
